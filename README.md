# Hey Guys 🌼🌙 🌱

💻🍂Computer Science student. I am a computer technician and a technology lover💜. Today I work voluntarily in the Computação Online (ComOn) @ comon.ufca project that produces audiovisual media, promoting the dissemination of content related to information technology .

🌷At the moment I am interested in the area of web development and UX / UI. I like to participate, organize and put into practice new ideas. Regular reader and in search of my best version.
